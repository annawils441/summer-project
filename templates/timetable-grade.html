        <h2>Grade details</h2>
        <p>Pupils will be assessed when they join Hatfield Junior Swimming School. A coach will put them into the grade that they believe they will do best from being in. New swimmers start at grade 1 and progress further through the grades based on performance and completing swimming checkpoints.</p>
